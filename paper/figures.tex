	\caption{A standard bivariate map (left) and a VSUP (right), used to encode an identical 10x10 grid of random data. Both use the same visual channels to encode value (position along the Viridis~\protect\cite{viridis} color map) and uncertainty (lightness and saturation). However, the VSUP uses a tree-like structure to allocate colors, defining more bins when uncertainty is low. This non-uniform budgeting affords better discrimination between values when uncertainty is low, even though the VSUP has fewer color bins (in this case, 15 to the bivariate map's 16). This tree-like structure also discourages analysis in regions where uncertainty may be unacceptably high.}

As glyphs become smaller, it becomes more difficult to distinguish their colors~\protect\cite{stone2014engineering}. VSUPs, by reducing the number of color categories as uncertainty increases, account for this ambiguity. On the right, the VSUP has been used to encode a 5x5 grid of random data.}

Continuous rather than discrete bivariate maps requires an error-prone color encoding and estimation task. Discrete bivariate maps, both VSUPs and otherwise, avoid these issues.

By suppressing uncertain information, the VSUP version removes the apparent spike in value at the second column, which is an artifact of sampling error due to poor coverage in that region. It also suppresses apparent inter-species variability in the solid orange spike at location ~9,500, which, again, is a function of poor coverage rather than a genuine per-strain difference.  }
