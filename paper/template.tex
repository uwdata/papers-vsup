Uncertainty is a vital concern in many datasets. Visualizations often use bivariate mappings to encode value and uncertainty simultaneously. Due to interference between visual channels, these bivariate maps are limited in resolution. We contribute Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Maps (VSUMs), an encoding technique that intentionally impairs value discrimination as uncertainty increases. In contrast to traditional bivariate maps, VSUMs alias values when uncertainty is high: expected values with lower uncertainty can be more precisely compared, whereas similar values with higher uncertainty are made harder to differentiate. By making informed binning decisions, VSUMs seek to better use the limited budget of discriminable marks in bivariate maps, and dissuade analysts from making decisions based on data with high uncertainty. We demonstrate several examples of VSUMs and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, VSUMs bias analysts to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.

Uncertainty is an inescapable component of collecting, presenting, and using data. A common goal in the communication of uncertainty is promoting \textbf{uncertainty-aware decisions}--- that is, the audience should be aware of the risks and rewards of certain decisions, modulate their confidence in their conclusions, and perhaps refrain from making a decision at all if there is too much uncertainty. In general, a goal of designers of visualizations of uncertain data is the \emph{information fusion} of data and uncertainty~\cite{riveiro2007evaluation}. A way that designers can contribute to this goal is by ensuring that uncertainty information is \textbf{well-integrated} with the rest of the data. That is, it should be difficult to discount or ignore the uncertainty in a dataset. Simultaneous presentation of uncertainty and value necessitates the construction of a bivariate map--- a relation, in terms of visual variables, between a 2-tuple $(value$,$uncertainty)$ and a set of marks.

In this paper, we present \textbf{Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Maps} (VSUMs) for integrating data and uncertainty information in thematic maps. VSUMs intentionally alias together data values with high uncertainty, affording greater discriminability as certainty increases. Rather than a traditional two dimensional bivariate map, with unique outputs for each relevant combination of data and uncertainty, VSUMs can be thought of as arcs: as uncertainty increases, values are mapped to smaller and smaller sets of outputs, culminating in a singularity where all inputs are mapped to an identical, highly uncertain mark regardless of their data value. Figure X shows an example of a VSUM, compared to a more traditional bivariate map. In this work, we describe the motivations behind the use of VSUMs, examples of their utility for decision-making under uncertainty, and validate that VSUMs in a crowd-sourced experiment.

MacEachren et al.~\cite{maceachren2012visual} evaluate a number of visual variables for representing uncertainty. 
\subsection{Interactions Between Visual Variables}

\section{Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Maps}

Correll et al. use a version of VSUMs in their LayerCake genomics visualization tool \cite{correll2015layercake,correll2011visualizing}, where the reads with insufficient certainty are mapped to a smaller and smaller set of increasing grey colors, creating the effect of uncertain values retreating into ``fog'' while highly certain values remain prominent.

\subsection{Examples}

\section{Evaluation}

%Show:
% 1) Juxtaposition makes people ignore/underweight uncertainty (even when they don't screw up the search task)
% 2) VSUMs make people, surprise surprise, bad at distinguishing highly uncertain values
% 3) But, they make uncertainty better-integrated
%    i) lower weights on uncertain values in decision-making
%    ii) a priori better discrimination

\subsection{Methods}

%conditions:
% 1) juxtaposed d map, u map
% 2) binned d/u map as per a priori jnds
% 3) vsm
% 4) continuous d/u map?
