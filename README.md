# Paper and Study Materials for CHI 2018 Paper "Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes"

This repository contains data and other supplemental material for [our paper](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/uncertainty-palettes), presented at [CHI 2018](https://chi2018.acm.org).

This work presents a technique, Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs) for generating palettes for bivariate color maps for visualizing value and uncertainty. For a general overview of the technique, consult our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@uwdata/value-suppressing-uncertainty-palettes-426130122ce9).

The [Paper](paper/) folder contains the paper itself, as well as all figures, and the [Talk Slides](paper/slides.pdf).
The [Study](study/) folder contains our study materials, including data tables.
The [Examples](examples/) folder contains running examples of VSUPs on real data sets.

A D3 module to create VSUPs is available on Github at [uwdata/vsup](https://github.com/uwdata/vsup).
