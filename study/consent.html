    <h3>Graphical Perception of Information Visualization</h3>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study about how users perceive information presented using different kinds of charts. You have been asked to participate because we need to know what perceptual factors determine how easy it is to read charts, given different amounts of data and different chart types. The purpose of the research is to determine what perceptual factors are involved in how users read and react to large amounts of data, using different presentation techniques.</p>
    <p>This study will include participants over 18 years of age who feel comfortable using an online interface to read graphs and answer questions about data.</p>
    <p><b>To reiterate, you are eligible for this study if and only if:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have not already completed this survey.</li>
        <li>You are over 18 years of age.</li>
        <li>You are comfortable with interpreting charts and graphs.</li>
        <li>You do not have a color vision deficiency (CVD) or color blindness </li>
        <li>You have JavaScript enabled in your browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4><b>What Will My Participation Involve?</b></h4>
    <p>If you decide to participate in this research you will be asked to answer questions about fictional data, using a number of charts or graphs to assist you in making decisions. You will be presented with a chart, and then asked about the information that the chart displays. We expect this study to take 20 minutes.</p>

    <p>We don't anticipate any risks from participation in this study greater than normal activity.</p>
