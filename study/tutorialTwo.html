          <h3>Uncertainty in Heat Maps: Task Two</h3>
         <p>
           In this second task, you are either <i>attacking</i> or <i>defending</i> in a game like Battleship.
           In this game, each opponent places their ships on locations on the board, without letting the opponent see where they are placed.
           The player then selects locations to fire missiles. If a player fires missiles in the same square as an opponent's ship, that ship is sunk.
           Spies have indicated the likely locations of ships and missiles, but there are varying levels of uncertainty in these predictions.
           This means that predictions with high uncertainty may not be trustworthy.
         </p>

         <p>
           As an attacker, you will be shown a prediction of the likely locations of ships, along with the uncertainty in this prediction.
           Click locations to target them, or to remove targets. Once you have selected all of your targets, click the "Confirm" button.
           Your objective is to hit as many ships as possible. Bright <span class="sYellow">YELLOW</span> squares with low uncertainty are the best targets.
         </p>

             <span>An example of the <i>attacker</i> task.
               The location circled here in yellow is forecasted as being highly likely to contain ships, and the confidence in that forecast is high.
               The location circled in green is also forecasted as highly likely to contain ships, but the prediction confidence is much lower.
               The location circled in blue is somewhat likely to contain ships, but the confidence in this prediction is high.
               Either the orange or pink location would be a reasonable choice of target.

         <p>
           As a defender, you will be shown a prediction of the likely locations of missile strikes, along with the uncertainty in these predictions.
           Click locations to place your ships, or to remove ships you previously placed. Once you have placed all of your ships, click the "Confirm" button.
           Your objective is to have as few of your ships hit as possible. Bright <span class="sPurple">PURPLE</span> squares with low uncertainty are the safest locations for ships.
         </p>

        <div>
          <img src="img/task2b.png" />
          <span>An example of the <i>defender</i> task. Here, ships should be placed in the safest locations.
            Circled red location is unlikely to be targeted, and confidence in this prediction is high.
            The circled orange location is unlikely to be targeted, but confidence in this prediction is low.
            The circled pink location is more dangerous than the orange location, but with a much higher confidence in prediction.
            As with the attacking task, either the orange or pink locations would be reasonable places to put ships.
