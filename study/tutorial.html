      <h3>Uncertainty in Heat Maps</h3>
        <p>
          In this study, you will be asked to interpret charts of data and uncertainty, and make predictions based on these charts.
          These charts represent <b>maps</b> of a region, where each location has an associated <b>value</b> and an <b>uncertainty</b> about that value.
          You will be presented with three kinds of charts.
        </p>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/juxtaposed.png" />
              <span>Two <i>side by side</i> charts. The map showing the data is on the left, and the map showing uncertainty is on the right. </span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/superimposed.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where each combination of data and uncertainty is given a different, unique color.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/vsum.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where, as we become more uncertain about data, the number of colors for showing the data decreases.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

         <p>
           There are two tasks in this study.
           In this first task, you will be given a chart, and asked to select a region in the chart that meets some criteria.
           For instance, you may be asked to find the location on the map with the greatest uncertainty, or lowest value.
           There may be multiple locations that meet the requirements.
           Select the <b>first location you see</b> that meets the requirements. Click on a location to input your answer.
         </p>

         <div class="figure">
           <div>
             <span>Click on the map location with the <b>greatest</b> uncertainty</span>
             <img src="img/task1.png" />
             <span>An example of the first task. Any of the locations highlighted in red would be valid answers.</span>
           </div>
         </div>

         <p>
           Click the "Ready" button when you are ready to being the first task.
